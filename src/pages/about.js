      It all started when at age of 6 when, I wired up a little 5V bulb in
      series with 2 AA batteries. I suddenly evolved from a well ornamented
      monkey into a modern man - I fell in love with one question - "How does it
      work and how do I do/fix it?". Wrote my first line of code when I was 12
      years old. Since then my future was defined.

      I find it deeply satisfying to build stuff that makes life easier. I have
      designed and developed: digital smoke sensor, DTMF controlled CNC machine,
      adaptive computer network algorithms, manipulators, web applications and
      more. Some of my work has been published in international conferences as
      well.

      Currently, I am working as a Software Engineer at a fast paced startup -
      churning business models into business logic by building scalable service
      layers.
